Web Scripting Unit

This is my Second Year Web Scripting Unit. Creating a CMS that allows compaines to come on and add, modify, and delete products. Furthermore, also allows customers to view products and add them to a 'virtual' basket. Finally, there is an admin side that allows admin to  check open orders and stock.

This is not fully functional. Needs Improvements.

Overall Mark: 82%
